*
* Version 1.0.2 20120109
* --------------------
* Changed Math.max(screen.width,screen.height) to window.outerWidth to measure width width instead of screen width again. Reasons why jQuery's (window).width() and window.innerWidth weren't working on iOS explained in http://tripleodeon.com/2011/12/first-understand-your-screen/
*
* Version 1.0.1 20120109
* --------------------
* Changed (window).width() which requires jQuery to Math.max(screen.width,screen.height) because it was reporting an incorrect size on iOS.
